# work-day-scheduler
## This is my work day scheduler. It works reasonably well
## There were several pieces of code here that I was particularly proud of
1. The if statement changing the color. I know its necessary to do it like this but I was pretty proud of it
2. The for of loop was a really good way to bring the objects back from local storage because I worked with a ta on trying a different way to bring the items back from local storage and that was much more complicated. 
3. Anything I did with jquery(two things) which apparently is better than javascript but I just view it as non-descriptive javascript
## There were several things that I would have probably changed too
1. Using a table in the html, the css was off I think because of my table and it was more work to fix it.
2. Not putting little save icons in, I was going to and looked them up and then forgot and now its time to turn it in. Maybe I'll get to it tomorrow. 
### I changed some of the css because I didn't like how it looked. It's neither here not there but I thought anyone looking at the project should know
